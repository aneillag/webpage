		<td class="tdbreak"> Chapter 4 is centered around how important  goals are and how it goes hand in hand with successful. Setting goals for yourself pushes the mind in the direction of completing actions that make these goals more attainable. I believe that this can definitely be beneficial to me as it would keep me more grounded ad focused on the steps that I need to take to attain the future that I desire. If I want to be a successful businesswoman I have to set more long term and short term goals</td>
		
		<td class="tdbreak"> Chapter 5 looks at the essence of time and making the most of it. Be the master of time and donâ€™t let time control you. It is very important to manage your time wisely and pursue your dreams and goals as time does not wait on anyone. Personally, I would never want to look back and regret not completing my bucket lists, I want to look back and be happy and know that I lived life to the fullest. It is better to go for your dreams than to be on your death bed regretting not doing something.</td>

		<td class="tdbreak"> </br> Chapter 6 speaks on surrounding yourself with people and things that are good for you. The type of people you are around shapes your way of life and your destiny. We must evaluate our relationships and group them based off these categories: Disassociation, limited association, and expanded association. Should I withdraw myself from the relationship?, limit the time spent around the person or spend more time around them. Basically, will the relationship add value to your life or take from it? It also speaks to the law of attraction, you attract what you are. I can attest to this pillar of success as I myself, have done an evaluation of my friends and realized that the minute I ditched the friends that did not serve me, my life started to progress in the right direction.</td>
		
		<td class="tdbreak">Chapter 7 discusses the importance of seeking knowledge on your own. You can be educated formally, but your will to always acquire knowledge and self-educate will be what makes you grow. This can be in the form of reading books or observation but you must know how to apply your newly-found wisdom. I read a lot, and it has opened a world of possibilities for me. I get to experience life through the words of others and by doing so I get to build an understanding of the concepts that are being used and the life lessons that are there to be learnt. Additionally, I also acquire life-long knowledge. </td>
