		<h2> PERSONALITY TRAIT </h2>
		</br>
		<p class="trait">My strongest trait is that I am free-spirited. This has negatively impacted my academic life as I feel like I'm being held back most of the times and it makes me unmotivated. I am not used to working on a schedule or being time-restrained. I can't travel as freely as I previously would because I have to be in the country for school. Socially, I am able to freely express myself by the way I dress, since there isn't really a set dress code.  have a lot of responsibilites and when </p></br>

	<p><h3>MY ROLE MODEL</h3></p>

		<p> Wanda Sykes once said " If you feel there's something out there that you're supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, stop wishing and just do it." </br></br> This really resonates with me because being a black woman in Hollywood can be extremely difficult as you are faced with the factors of racism, sexism and genderism and you have to have the courage and audacity to enter such a space. She really motivates me to keep going until I achieve my goals and helped me realize that sometimes the only obstacle is yourself. Wanda Sykes is a writer, comedian and spectacular actress. She stars in the UpShaws, my favourite show on Netflix and she also happens to be my favourite character. </p>

		<p> I believe this test is somewhat accuracy ad its a good basis to discover the fundamentals/ nitty-gritties of who you are as a person. As it relates to me, the test was accurate to the T. I do excel in the arts and I have often been described as the traits that are displayed above.</p>
